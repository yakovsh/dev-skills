# Resolving Zizmor Warnings in GitHub Actions

## Overview

zizmor identifies security vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows. This skill documents
the decision guidelines for resolving each warning type: when to fix, how to fix, and when
to suppress with an inline comment explaining why.

**Core principle:** Fix the vulnerability whenever possible. Suppress only when the fix would
break required functionality, and always include a reason in the suppression comment.

## Prerequisites

This work should be done on a branch in a git worktree. Before starting any work, verify
you are in the worktree directory and on the correct branch:

```bash
pwd          # should be the worktree path
git branch   # should show the feature branch, not main
```

## Workflow Order

Always work in this order. Each step is a separate commit.

1. **Add zizmor CI job** using the standard template
2. **Configure dependabot** to batch github-actions updates weekly
3. **Add local workflow linting** to `bin/setup` and `bin/ci` (see below). Skip if these
   scripts don't exist in the project.
4. **Pin actions** with `pinact run`
5. **Address zizmor warnings** by severity (high → medium → low → informational).
6. **Ensure all permissions are job-level.** Check every workflow file for top-level
   `permissions:` blocks. Replace with `permissions: {}` and add per-job permissions.
   This goes beyond what zizmor flags — zizmor misses single-job workflows. Commit.
7. **Run actionlint** and fix any findings. Commit.

## Running pinact

Run `pinact run --min-age 10` from the repository root. This pins all actions in `.github/workflows/` to SHA hashes, skipping any versions published less than 10 days ago.

## Running zizmor

**Always run zizmor with a GitHub token** so that online audits (like `ref-version-mismatch`
and `impostor-commit`) can resolve SHAs against the GitHub API. Without a token, these audits
are silently skipped and findings will only surface in CI.

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) zizmor .
```

Filter severity by passing the flag `--min-severity=<level>` where level can be `high`, `medium`, or `low`. Informational warnings may be emitted by omitting this flag entirely.

### Auto-fix workflow

For each severity level (high, then medium, then low, then informational):

1. Run `zizmor --fix=all --min-severity=<level> .` to auto-correct fixable findings (`--fix` alone uses safe mode which silently holds back some fixes; use `--fix=all` and rely on diff review as the safety net)
2. **STOP and review the diff.** Check each auto-fix against the Decision Guide below.
   - `cache-poisoning` fixes will disable caching — almost always revert these and suppress instead
   - `artipacked` fixes add `persist-credentials: false` — revert if the workflow needs `git push`
   - `superfluous-actions` fixes replace actions with inline code — always revert these and suppress instead
   - `bot-conditions` auto-fix replaces `github.actor` with `user.login` — revert and apply the dual check instead (see rule file)
   - `template-injection` fixes are generally correct
3. Revert any incorrect fixes
4. For reverted fixes, apply the correct resolution manually (e.g., suppress with a reason)
5. Manually fix anything `--fix` didn't handle. **For `excessive-permissions`: you MUST research each action's permissions. Do not guess. See the permission research process below.**
6. Run `zizmor --min-severity=<level> .` to verify a clean check at this severity level
7. Commit

After completing all default severity levels, run a pedantic pass:

1. Run `zizmor --persona=pedantic --min-severity=high .`
2. Address findings the same way as above — the most common pedantic finding is
   `excessive-permissions` on single-job workflows where zizmor's default persona doesn't
   flag it. Apply the same fix: `permissions: {}` at workflow level, scoped per job.
3. Run `zizmor --persona=pedantic --min-severity=high .` to verify clean
4. Commit

## Decision Guide by Rule

When you encounter a zizmor finding, read the corresponding rule file in `references/` for
full decision guidance, suppression checklists, and examples. Only read the rules you need.

| Rule | File | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| `artipacked` | `references/rule-artipacked.md` | Fix (add `persist-credentials: false`); suppress only if job does `git push` |
| `template-injection` | `references/rule-template-injection.md` | Always fix (move expressions to `env:` vars) |
| `excessive-permissions` | `references/rule-excessive-permissions.md` | Always fix (set `permissions: {}` at workflow level, scope per job) |
| `dangerous-triggers` | `references/rule-dangerous-triggers.md` | Fix or suppress with 5-point checklist |
| `secrets-outside-env` | `references/rule-secrets-outside-env.md` | Fix (add `environment:`) or suppress with 3-point checklist |
| `bot-conditions` | `references/rule-bot-conditions.md` | Always fix (dual check: `actor` + `user.login`); revert auto-fix |
| `superfluous-actions` | `references/rule-superfluous-actions.md` | Always suppress (never replace with inline code) |
| `cache-poisoning` | `references/rule-cache-poisoning.md` | Suppress (default); revert auto-fixes; only escalate if custom cache keys |
| `unpinned-images` | `references/rule-unpinned-images.md` | Suppress (default); digest pinning is nontrivial |
| `dependabot-execution` | `references/rule-dependabot-execution.md` | Fix or suppress with 3-point checklist |
| `dependabot-cooldown` | `references/rule-dependabot-cooldown.md` | Always fix (add `cooldown: default-days: 10` to all ecosystems) |

Permission mappings for `excessive-permissions` are in `references/permission-mappings.md`.

## Suppression Format

Always use inline comments with the rule name and a reason:

```
# zizmor: ignore[rule-name] -- reason why suppression is necessary
```

The `--` separator before the reason is a convention for readability. Never suppress without
a reason. If you can't articulate why the fix would break something, apply the fix instead.

## Standard Zizmor CI Job

Add this job to the repository's main CI workflow file (often `ci.yml` or `ci-checks.yml`).

**Placement matters.** Before inserting, find the existing lint job (rubocop, eslint,
golangci-lint, etc.) in the workflow and place `lint-actions` immediately after it. If there
is no lint job, place it immediately before the first test job. **Never append it to the end
of the file** — it is a linting concern, not a test or deployment step:

```yaml
lint-actions:
  name: GitHub Actions audit
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      with:
        persist-credentials: false

    - name: Run actionlint
      uses: rhysd/actionlint@v1.7.11

    - name: Run zizmor
      uses: zizmorcore/zizmor-action@v0.5.2
      with:
        advanced-security: false
```

Use version tags, not SHA hashes — run `pinact run --min-age 10` immediately after adding
this job to pin them. This ensures the SHAs match what pinact produces for the rest of the
workflow.

**Before adding this job, check if the workflow already has a standalone `actionlint` job.**
If it does, remove it — `lint-actions` replaces it. Do not create duplicate actionlint runs.

## Local Workflow Linting

If the project has a `bin/ci` script (or equivalent like `config/ci.rb`), add workflow
linting so developers catch issues locally before pushing. If `bin/setup` also exists, add
tool installation there too. **Skip this section entirely if there is no local CI script.**

### bin/setup — tool installation

Check if `actionlint`, `shellcheck`, and `zizmor` are already installed. If not, install
them using the platform's package manager. Read the existing `bin/setup` script to understand
its conventions before adding to it.

**shellcheck is required** — actionlint uses it to lint shell scripts in `run:` blocks.
Without shellcheck, actionlint silently skips script checks and local results won't match CI.

Install all three tools using the same pattern:

```bash
for tool in actionlint shellcheck zizmor; do
  if ! command -v "$tool" &> /dev/null; then
    if command -v brew &> /dev/null; then
      brew install "$tool"
    elif command -v pacman &> /dev/null; then
      sudo pacman -S --noconfirm "$tool"
    else
      echo "Error: install $tool manually" >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done
```

Adapt this to match the script's existing style (e.g., if it uses functions, conditionals,
or a different error pattern, follow that convention).

### bin/ci — running the linters

Add actionlint and zizmor as separate steps. Read the existing `bin/ci` script to understand
its conventions before adding to it.

```bash
# Lint GitHub Actions workflows
actionlint
zizmor .
```

Each tool should be a separate command so failures are clearly attributable. Place these
near other linting steps if the script has them.

### Examples

- **bin/setup + config/ci.rb**: [lexxy#882](https://github.com/basecamp/lexxy/pull/882)
- **Makefile**: [basecamp-sdk@aa1f2d50](https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-sdk/commit/aa1f2d50)

## Dependabot Configuration

### GitHub Actions entry

Ensure `.github/dependabot.yml` includes a github-actions entry with batching.
The schedule **must** be `weekly` — not daily.

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: github-actions
  directory: "/"
  groups:
    github-actions:
      patterns:
        - "*"
  schedule:
    interval: weekly
  cooldown:
    default-days: 7
```

The `groups` block batches all action updates into a single PR instead of one PR per action.

### Cooldown on all ecosystems

Add cooldown to **every** ecosystem entry in `dependabot.yml`. Use semver-granular cooldowns
for real package ecosystems so low-risk patches flow faster while major bumps get more soak
time:

```yaml
# For package ecosystems (bundler, npm, gomod, gradle, pip, etc.)
cooldown:
  semver-major-days: 7
  semver-minor-days: 3
  semver-patch-days: 2
  default-days: 7

# For github-actions (semver-granular keys are NOT supported)
cooldown:
  default-days: 7
```

If an ecosystem entry is missing the cooldown block, add it. If an existing cooldown block
has different values, **override them** with the values above — these are the standard.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Guessing what permissions an action needs | **Read the action's README.** If it's not in the permission mappings table, research it before proceeding. |
| Accepting `cache-poisoning` auto-fixes without review | `--fix=all` disables caching; almost always revert and suppress instead |
| Suppressing without a reason | Always explain WHY the fix can't be applied |
| Suppressing `template-injection` | This should always be fixed, never suppressed |
| Adding `persist-credentials: false` to a workflow that does `git push` | Suppress `artipacked` with a comment instead |
| Fixing permissions by removing the block entirely | Move to job-level, don't remove — implicit permissions may be too broad |
| Using `--fix` instead of `--fix=all` | Safe mode silently holds back fixes; use `--fix=all` and review the diff |
| Committing without verifying clean zizmor output | Always re-run `zizmor --min-severity=<level> .` before committing |
| Analyzing all findings up front before starting work | Follow the workflow order step by step — CI job, dependabot, local linting, pin, then fix by severity |
| Adding the zizmor CI job at the end of the workflow file | Place it near existing lint jobs — it's a linting concern, not a test |
| Replacing an action with inline code for `superfluous-actions` | Always suppress — actions are more maintainable and receive upstream fixes |
| Not specifying permissions on reusable workflow caller jobs | Caller jobs must declare permissions; reusable workflows inherit from the caller |
| Adding tools to bin/setup when there's no bin/ci | Only add local linting if a local CI script exists to run the tools |
| Running commands in the main repo instead of the worktree | Verify `pwd` and `git branch` before starting |

## Common PR Feedback (Incorrect or Misleading)

Automated reviewers (Copilot, cubic, etc.) frequently flag these. They are wrong or
misleading — dismiss them.

| Feedback | Why it's wrong |
|----------|---------------|
| `ruby/setup-ruby` with `bundler-cache: true` needs `actions: write` | No. Bundler cache works with `contents: read`. The cache API uses the implicit `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Do not add `actions: write`. |
| `persist-credentials: false` will break `git fetch` / `git worktree` | Only true for private repos. All our target repos are public — unauthenticated HTTPS fetch works fine. |
| `cooldown` is not a valid Dependabot configuration key | It is valid. GitHub added `cooldown` to Dependabot v2 config in late 2025. Copilot's training data predates this feature. |
| Checkout version inconsistency (v3 in existing jobs vs v6 in lint-actions) | The skill pins existing versions as-is; upgrading is dependabot's job after merge. The lint-actions job template uses v6 independently. |
